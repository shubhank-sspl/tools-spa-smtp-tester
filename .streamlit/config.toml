primaryColor="#4A90E2" 

# Background color of the main content area (e.g., a light off-white)
backgroundColor="#F9F9F9" 

# Background color of the sidebar and secondary containers (e.g., a true white)
secondaryBackgroundColor="#FFFFFF" 

# Color for text

# Font family for the app
# Use 'sans serif' for a clean, modern look

[server]
# Set a server timeout to a generous 60 seconds (default is 10)
# This prevents timeouts during long connection attempts or authentication delays.
# In this specific app, the SMTP timeout is handled in the Python code, 
# but this is a good practice for general apps.
# The default is usually fine, but included here for completeness.
# fileWatcherType = "poll"
